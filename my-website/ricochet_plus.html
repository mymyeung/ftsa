      <h1>How to Play Ricochet Robots?</h1>
      Play with 2-4 players to have the best gaming exprience.
      More players are also possible, and you may also practice on your own.
      <h2>Winning Condition</h2>
      The game ends when all 17 unique cards are claimed.
      The player with the highest score wins the game.
      <h2>Moving a Robot</h2>
      Robots can only move in a straight line (horizontally or vertically; by buttons or keyboard keys). The robot can stop at a grid only when its way is blocked by a wall or another robot. (It is then considered one "move". It cannot stop anywhere in the middle.)
      <h2>Game Flow</h2>
      A card (indicating a unique destination) is drawn per round.
      Your aim is to think of a shortest route (least "moves") for the robot to meet the destination. For example, when a "<font color="blue">@</font>" card is drawn, you have to send the <font color="blue">blue robot</font> (represented by the blue disc) to the grid marked with "<font color="blue">@</font>". You may use other robots to help you out, but "moves" of other robots are also counted.
      <h2>Timing the Game</h2>
      Players may shout out numbers (numbers of "moves", for unlimited times) any time after the card of that round is revealed (by pressing "Draw Cards"). After the first shout, the timer starts counting for 60 seconds (press "Start Timer"). During the minute, all players can still shout out numbers of shorter moves. When the time is up, the played who shouted the smallest number performs his/her moves.
      <h2>Claiming a Card</h2>
      If the player successfully send the correct robot to the correct destination within the number of moves, the card is claimed (press "Card Claimed") and the player scores 1 point. Otherwise, if the player failed to do so, press "Back to Marker" to send the robots back to their original positions, and press "Back to Deck" to shuffle the card back to the deck. After that, start a new round by pressing "Draw Card".
      <h2>House Rules</h2>
      (1) Score Deduction: If the player (who shouted the least moves) fails to send the correct robot to the correct destination, he/she loses 1 point.
      (2) Invalid Card: If a card indicates a destination which can be reached within 4 moves, shuffle the card back to the deck and draw a new one.
      (3) Consecutive Shouting Banned: After a player shout out a number, he/she cannot shout out another number until another player shouts a number.
      <h1>How to Play Ricochet Robots+?</h1>
      You are execpted to know the rules of Ricochet Robots before you add these optional house rules. All the rules of Ricochet Robots applies to Ricochet Robots+, except for the following additional rules:
      <h2>More Cards!</h2>
      Instead of drawing 1 card each round, 1-3 cards of unique colors are drawn ("modes 1-3", switch mode by "Easier" and "Harder" buttons).
      The player claims <u>all</u> revealed cards of the round only when he/she successfully send <u>all</u> 1-3 robots to their respective destinations within the number of moves (typed in the "#" textbox), and scores 1 POINT PER CARD. (Otherwise, loses 1-3 points.) You may change the mode before the game (or between rounds if all players agree), but not when a card is being revealed. If the remaining cards in the deck do not have any combinations that fulfill the drawing rules (1-3 cards of unique color), the game ends early.
      Alternative Rules: The winner of a round get to choose the mode of the next round (within combination constraint). The game ends when the deck is EMPTY.
